            <p>Hi there, my name is <strong>Johnny Jue</strong>! I'm entering my third year studying <strong>Mechanical Engineering
            </strong> and I wanted to join Hack4Impact in order to broaden my skillset while doing something really cool for the 
            community.</p> 
            <p>Some other activities that I really enjoy include <strong>working out, hanging out at the beach, and cooking and 
            baking</strong> . Something that I baked very recently that I'm super proud of was a cookies and cream ice cream cake for my 
            roommmate's birthday!
